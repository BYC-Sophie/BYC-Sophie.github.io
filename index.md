## About Me

Hi! I am currently a first-year Ph.D. student in Information Science at Cornell University and am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Angelique Taylor](https://airlab.cis.cornell.edu/). Before joining Cornell, I obtained my Master's degree from Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and a Bachelor of Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University(https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) with Outstanding Graduate Award and Academic Excellence Scholarship. I also participated in the winter research program at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) for Robotics.

At CMU, I am fortunate to work with [Prof. Sherry Tongshuang Wu](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sherryw/) on AI Evaluation, with [Prof. Motahhare Eslami](https://www.hcii.cmu.edu/people/motahhare-eslami) and [Prof. Haiyi Zhu](https://hcii.cmu.edu/people/haiyi-zhu) on Equity in HCI. I also participated in a remote research internship with [Prof. Xiaojvan Ma](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~mxj/) on Human-Robot Value Alignment.

At SJTU, I am fortunate to be adviced by [Prof. Pradeep Kumar Ray](https://sites.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/entrepreneurship/views/pradeep_bio.html) on Technology Entrepreneurship. I am curretly co-mentored by Prof. Pradeep Ray and [Prof. Guangtao Zhai](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=E6zbSYgAAAAJ&hl=en), on asisstive technology for ASD detection and intervention.
