about: |
  Hi! I am a second-year Ph.D. student in Information Science at Cornell University advised by [Prof. Angelique Taylor](https://airlab.cis.cornell.edu/).

  I received my master’s degree from Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). I was fortunate to work with [Prof. Sherry Tongshuang Wu](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sherryw/), [Prof. Motahhare Eslami](https://www.hcii.cmu.edu/people/motahhare-eslami), and [Prof. Haiyi Zhu](https://hcii.cmu.edu/people/haiyi-zhu). I also participated in a remote research internship with [Prof. Xiaojuan Ma](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~mxj/).

  I received my B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/). I was fortunate to work with [Prof. Pradeep Kumar Ray](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WUSRbsMAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Guangtao Zhai](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=E6zbSYgAAAAJ&hl=en). During this time, I also participated in the winter research program at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) for Robotics.
